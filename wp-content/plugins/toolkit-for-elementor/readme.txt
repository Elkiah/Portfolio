Enhance Elementor with time-saving, speed-boosting features including Booster, Syncer, Themeless, and Toolbox.

== DESCRIPTION ==

### Meet ToolKit For Elementor.

ToolKit For Elementor is a revolutionary new framework specially designed to improve and enhance designers and developers workflows when using Elementor.

TFE was inspired by, and a product of, listening to the needs of Elementor users- both designers and developer alike. Though we are a third-party add-on, we have official approval and blessings from Elementor (and we plan on coordinating with their dev team throughout our Roadmap and theirs).

We seek to provide an additional channel for Elementor users to voice their ideas and features that they think would be amazing additions to Elementor- and if the idea has merit and crowd approval, consider whether or not it makes sense to integrate it into ToolKit.

### BOOSTER:

Speed up media-heavy pages with Booster’s set of performance tweaks specifically dialed in for the WordPress framework.

* Minify & Combine CSS, JS, and HTML files
* LazyLoad Images + Videos (Great for Media-Heavy sites!)
* Apply Server-level performance tweaks such as GZip Compression, Etags, Leverage Browser Caching, and More
* Unload Common, Unused WP Files and Server Requests
* Run GTMetrix scans and get recommendations right from your WP Dashboard
* Dequeue unused Elementor widgets in the editor and display custom widget tooltips/notes with Widget Manager

### SYNCER:

No cloud or third-party servers needed!

Other services have you upload your templates to a 3rd party cloud. With ToolKit’s Syncer feature, connect directly to your other Elementor sites and import saved templates to speed up your workflow.

* Securely connect to other Elementor sites on your license
* Quickly import saved templates from your other sites
* Save tons of time!
* Use on unlimited # of sites!

### THEMELESS:

We’re super excited to announce THEMELESS for ELEMENTOR

Using our THEMELESS feature, WP Themes are no longer required when working with Elementor as the WP Theme Framework is disabled and bypassed! With no theme css, js or scripts to call, THEMELESS results in faster sites with fewer server requests.

* WP Theme Framework is Disabled.
* Compatible with Elementor Free + Pro- though ToolKit was really designed to excel with Elementor Pro
* Global templates built via Elementor's Theme Builder
* As of Elementor v2.9, works great with Elementor's new global styling aka Theme Styling framework!

We're looking forward to hearing what features Elementor users would love to see implemented into ToolKit as with each update, more tools and features will become available!
